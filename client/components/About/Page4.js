            Dezo was crafted by three friends with one mission: to bring together the lively, the bold, and the adventure seekers who are ready to worry less about tomorrow and focus more on being in the moment.<br></br><br></br>

            Dezo was created for those who know the power of their body begins with feeling good about what’s on the inside, which is why we’ve created products that does more than just satisfy your thirst. We want you to truly feel good about what you are putting into your body.<br></br><br></br>

            After years of celebrating together in college, we began to realize that sugary mixed drinks led to a day of recovering, beer resulted in bloating, and spiked seltzers left us feeling dehydrated. So we teamed up to craft something that didn’t exist: a low calorie, gluten free vodka spiked fruit water mixed with some of the world’s most vitalizing natural ingredients.
